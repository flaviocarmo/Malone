# Malone

Malone is a tool to test Web APIs and is inspired by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

Due to various factors we couldn't use Postman in our organization so we built something custom enough for our internal needs, but general enough to possibly be useful to others.

### Name

Malone is named after one of the all time great NBA power forwards: [Karl Malone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone). It is a homage to Postman, as he earned the nickname "The Mailman" because he "always delivered".
